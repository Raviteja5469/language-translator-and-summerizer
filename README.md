🌐 Smart Language Translator & Summarizer

This project is a Python-based language translation tool designed to simplify communication across languages. It features text-to-speech, speech-to-text translation, and text summarization, making it ideal for quick, efficient language processing.

🚀 Features

Text-to-Speech Translation: Convert translated text into spoken audio for easy understanding.

Speech-to-Text Translation: Automatically transcribe spoken language into text and translate it into the desired language.

Text Summarization: Summarize long texts into concise overviews to capture the main points quickly.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): For text processing and summarization.

Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS): For converting text into speech.

SpeechRecognition: For speech-to-text conversion using voice input.

Google Translate API: For accurate text and speech translation.


💡 How to Use

1. Input Text/Speech: Input text or speak into the application.


2. Translate: Choose the target language for translation.


3. Summarize: Generate summaries from long texts to grasp the key points.


4. Listen: Hear the translated text through the text-to-speech functionality.
